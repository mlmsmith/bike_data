# bike data Project
## This project analyses the differences in the usage of a bike rental company's services between members and casual customers. The aim of the project was to discover insights which would enable suggestions to be made to the company's management as to the best strategies to employ to convert casual customers into members. The project was completed using pandas for querying the data and seaborn for visualisations. The equivalent SQL statements are also provided in the comments of each cell.
